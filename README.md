# About Conway's Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life is a game where a set of cells automatically update according to a set of rules.

Standard Rules:
	<br>- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
	<br>- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
	<br>- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
	<br>- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell as if by reproduction.
